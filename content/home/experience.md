As an expert in Agile, Software Development and Design, Team Leadership, CI/CD, TDD/BDD, C#, JavaScript, PowerShell, SQL, Git, Windows, JIRA, Confluence, Microservices, OWASP and DevOps in general, I'm using my expertise to ensure successful Agile DevOps adoption and drive use of quality processes and development of quality code.

As part of my wider role, I have contributed to multiple projects and teams at State&nbsp;Street.

**Achievements:**

- I've led by example and rewritten hacky non-tested code to a quality testable and tested code (in Go using Godog, in JavaScript/Node.js using Mocha/Chai, in PowerShell using Pester) and further promoting TDD and BDD as part of a microservices and Kubernetes team. Example: a production-ready Vault Enterprise Kubernetes operator.
- I've contributed to building on-prem self-service to spin up and manage Kubernetes clusters for multiple tenants and setup a secure CI/CD for them (GoCD/Concourse).
- I've been part of a team which builds secure and approved base system images. I've used my unique Windows expertise and created hardened Windows images on AWS (AMI) using PowerShell/Pester and SSM automation. See http://bit.ly/2lMLjFg
- I've fixed broken Concourse/Postgresql deployment using my SQL troubleshooting expertise. See http://bit.ly/2mf8NTB
- I have found a huge inefficiency in an old timesheet system used by thousands of employees (est. £1-10m loss/year) and I took my own initiative to fix it - see http://bit.ly/2kjw9a4. This initiative has won me a #GTSRecognition award and popularity across hundreds of employees. Eventually, it has been added to a Cost & Process Improvement Programme as an official project.

**Technology stack:**
- TDD, BDD, Go, JavaScript, PowerShell, Ansible, Terraform, Vault, Consul, Pester, Docker, Packer, Vagrant
- Kubernetes, AWS, Visual Studio Code, Artifactory, Concourse, GoCD, GitHub, JIRA, Chocolatey, Microsoft Office, Linux, Windows, WebEx API
